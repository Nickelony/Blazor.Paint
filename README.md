# Blazor.Paint
A Paint app and `<canvas>` API made entirely from scratch in **Blazor**. It supports Layers, Select and Move, Flood Fill, Import / Export, Undo / Redo, and many other features.

This app was my engineering project. I wanted to prove, that even though Blazor doesn't natively support the `<canvas>` element (at least at the time of me making this app), we can still use it to make something highly functional.
